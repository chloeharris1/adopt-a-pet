![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

A project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer career path, using React Router to add client-side routing to a React application.

This is a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

## Built With

- React v17
- React Router v5

### Functionality

- The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.

- The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.

- The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.

- When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.

- When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.

- From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Back” button that will take them to page they were previously on.
