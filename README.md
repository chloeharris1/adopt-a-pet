![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description 

A project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer career path, using React Router to add client-side routing to a React application. 

This is a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

## Tasks
* The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.

* The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.

* The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.

* When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.

* When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.

* From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Back” button that will take them to page they were previously on.
